# Easybank-Website
Easybank Website. I developed this website for learning purposes. In this example, you will see part of my Front- End development skills.
At the moment right now I upload only to the desktop version of the site /I follow the requirements of the task for approximately 24-inch good view of the site /. Late I will upload the mobile version /styles/ for the site.
It's important to know I used the BEM convention to give the class names of the element.
